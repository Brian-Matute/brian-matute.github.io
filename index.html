        <h2>Autobiography</h2>

        <p>My name is Brian Matute, and I’m a junior majoring in broadcast journalism. I was born and raised in Miami and have always had a love and passion for sports and broadcasting. I’ve always had a love for learning about new and interesting stories. I love wrapping my head around the intricacies that come in each story. In my opinion, no medium allows us to share stories better than broadcast. Whether it be politics, local news, or emotional feature stories, broadcast allows us to connect with others. I hope to gain experience and improve my skills day by day. My dream for the future beyond my time at the University of Miami is to make an impact on journalism as a whole. No matter the scale, I want to make an impact on others through my journalism, specifically via the broadcast medium. My passion and love for broadcasting is a big part of who I am today and I'm motivated by the thought of one day having a career in this field.
