        <h2>Autobiography</h2>

        <p>My name is Brian Matute,and I’m a junior majoring in broadcast journalism. I’ve been a Miami Hurricanes fan for as long as I can remember. I was born and raised in Miami and have always had a love and passion for sports and broadcasting. Both of my parents work at the University of Miami, which has led to my having a deep-rooted passion for this school since I was a child. I’ve always had a love for learning about new and interesting stories. I love wrapping my head around the intricacies that come in each story. For this reason, I love watching shows and movies and discussing them. However, my love for stories doesn’t stop at movies and shows, as I also have a love for stories as they relate to sports. Although I find it fun and interesting to watch sports to see who wins, I find that the surrounding stories and narratives carry significant weight. Whether it be a player being traded or two teams with a deep rivalry facing each other, sports contain interesting storylines that only make me enjoy watching them more. In my opinion, no medium allows us to share stories better than broadcast. Whether it be politics, local news, or emotional feature stories, broadcast allows us to connect with others. By each member in our vast local, national, and global community sharing their stories, we can begin to understand each other better; and that is at the heart of broadcast journalism. As previously mentioned, I am majoring in broadcast journalism at the University of Miami’s School of Communications. I intend to use this to explore a career in broadcasting. My passion for broadcasting can be traced back to my elementary school, where there was a morning announcements group that I was a part of. We would broadcast our morning announcements live to the classroom TVs of the school.
          During my tenure in this morning announcements group, I learned useful tools both in front of and behind the camera. Although it was a very small-scale production, it equipped me with the fundamental skills needed for this field. This simple morning announcements group sparked my passion for broadcasting which has been burning bright ever since. As I continue my tenure here at the University of Miami, I have some goals set in mind. Firstly, I hope to foster new connections. Although it is important in any field, fostering new connections and meeting new people is paramount in my intended field of broadcasting. I hope to make strong bonds with like-minded people and grow my networking skills. I also hope to gain experience for the future. Experience is another vital piece of the puzzle for achieving success in my intended field. I hope to gain experience to improve my skills day by day. My dream for the future beyond my time here at the University of Miami is to make an impact on journalism as a whole. No matter the scale, I want to make an impact on others through my journalism, specifically via the broadcast medium. My passion and love for broadcasting is a big part of who I am today and am motivated by the thought of one day having a career in this field. My ultimate hope is to make my elementary school self proud by living out my dream.
