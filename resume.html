        <h2>Additional Information</h2>
        <p>My name is Brian Matute. I am currently a student at the University of Miami, majoring in Broadcast Journalism. I enjoy exploring new cultures, acquiring knowledge about diverse subjects, and delving into facts that intrigue me. This passion for learning propelled me to excel in multiple Advanced Placement classes in high school, including Psychology, United States History, U.S. Government and Politics, and Human Geography. As a result, I graduated with the Miami-Dade County Superintendentâ€™s Diploma of Distinction. However, my thirst for knowledge extends beyond the classroom. I also derive immense satisfaction from understanding people on a personal level. This became evident when I volunteered at the Ronald McDonald House, a haven for children with medical needs. There, I had the privilege of learning more about the families and their unique stories. As I move forward, my goal is to craft a meaningful story for myself and become a part of the stories of others along the way. </p>
