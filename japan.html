        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>In <time datetime="1603">1603</time>, after decades of civil warfare, the Tokugawa shogunate (a military-led, dynastic government) ushered in a long period of relative political stability and isolation from foreign influence. For more than two centuries, this policy enabled Japan to enjoy a flowering of its indigenous culture. Japan opened its ports after signing the Treaty of Kanagawa with the US in <time datetime="1854">1854</time> and began to intensively modernize and industrialize.</p>
        
        <p>During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan became a regional power that was able to defeat the forces of both China and Russia. It occupied Korea, Formosa (Taiwan), and southern Sakhalin Island. In <time datetime="1937">1937</time>, it launched a full-scale invasion of China.</p>
       
        <p> Japan attacked US forces at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in <time datetime="1941">1941</time>, triggering America's entry into World War II, and Japan soon occupied much of East and Southeast Asia. After its defeat in World War II, the country recovered to become an economic power and a US ally.</p>
        
        <p>While the emperor retains his throne as a symbol of national unity, elected politicians hold the decision-making power. After three decades of unprecedented growth, Japan's economy experienced a major slowdown starting in <time datetime="1900">1900</time>, but the country remains an economic power.</p>
        
        <p>In <time datetime="2011">2011</time>, Japan's strongest-ever earthquake and an accompanying tsunami devastated the northeast part of Honshu, killed thousands, and damaged several nuclear power plants. ABE Shinzo was reelected as prime minister in <time datetime="2012">2012</time>, and he embarked on ambitious economic and security reforms to improve Japan's economy and bolster the country's international standing.</p>
        
        <p> In <time datetime="2019">2019</time>, ABE became Japan's longest-serving post-war prime minister; he resigned in <time datetime="2020">2020</time> and was succeeded by SUGA Yoshihide. KISHIDA Fumio became prime minister in <time datetime="2021">2021</time>.</p>
